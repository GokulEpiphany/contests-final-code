       "xxbos xxmaj economists generally agree : xxmaj china must overhaul its huge but wasteful economy if it wants to continue to grow in the years to come . xxmaj that means limiting political interference in banking and the financial system , making bloated industries more sensitive to market forces and lowering barriers against foreign trade and investment . xxmaj proponents took heart in late 2012 when xxmaj president xxmaj xi xxmaj jinping took formal control of the xxmaj chinese xxmaj communist xxmaj party with pledges to crack down on corruption and cut red tape . xxmaj today , as xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi nears the end of his first five - year term , much of the optimism among economists has faded . xxmaj china remains heavily dependent on large investments and has maintained brisk but slowing economic growth only with a steep rise in government - steered lending . xxmaj still , his administration has made some small changes , and there have been hints that xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi may focus more on economic overhauls when he starts his second term . xxmaj here is what xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi has done so far — and , more important , what he has not done . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj experts give some credit for xxmaj china ’s moves on currency . xxmaj beijing persuaded the xxmaj international xxmaj monetary xxmaj fund in 2015 to admit its currency , the renminbi , to an elite club of currencies in which central banks hold their reserves . xxmaj to win approval , xxmaj china made it much easier to move money in and out of the country , and shifted the daily pegging of the renminbi to the dollar to a slightly more market - based system . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj those moves have been in doubt lately . xxmaj opening up money flows led so many xxmaj chinese families and companies to send their money out of the country that the renminbi weakened against the dollar and the xxmaj chinese government had to spend nearly $ 1 trillion to prop it up . xxmaj in the past 12 months , xxmaj beijing has reimposed many restrictions on sending money out of the country . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj faced early last year with a huge supply of unsold real estate and stalling construction , xxmaj beijing decided to make it much easier for banks to issue mortgages . xxmaj this set off a buying frenzy in big cities that slightly pared the backlog of empty apartments . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj what looked like a bubble before looks like one even more so now . xxmaj beijing and xxmaj shanghai already have some of the world ’s highest real estate prices in relation to local incomes . xxmaj developers are still heavily in debt . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china made limited moves to allow foreigners to trade more extensively in the bond market , hedge their currency risk and connect its stock markets in xxmaj shanghai and xxmaj shenzhen with xxmaj hong xxmaj kong , which has long served as xxmaj china ’s financial gateway to the rest of the world . xxmaj local governments have been discouraged from setting up companies that borrow heavily to pay for public works . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj any moves to open up have been overshadowed by tighter government control after a 2015 stock market crash . a major stock market index passed on including xxmaj chinese stocks , citing the need for further improvements . xxmaj new public - private partnerships have emerged to continue xxmaj china ’s borrowing spree . xxmaj while xxmaj chinese officials had hoped that the private partners would force local governments to make wiser and more cautious investments , the initial “ private ” partners have tended to be state - owned enterprises , which typically share local xxunk interest in borrowing heavily to create jobs . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china has moved to help banks plagued by a rising tide of bad loans . xxmaj banks have been allowed to swap a few of those unpaid loans for equity stakes in troubled borrowers . xxmaj asset management companies have been buying some bad loans from banks . xxmaj banks have been given growing discretion to set interest rates based on the creditworthiness of borrowers . xxmaj the interest rates that banks pay on deposits have been deregulated , allowing a competition among banks that benefits depositors . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj those moves are not enough . xxmaj banks still face a large overhang of loans to money - losing companies with little hope of repayment . xxmaj banks continue to roll over loans to troubled borrowers and extend huge loans to politically connected borrowers , including influential private companies as well as state - owned enterprises . xxmaj if the economy does slow sharply , the mountain of bad loans will grow much more . xxmaj at the same time , entrepreneurs continue to complain that the system denies them the access to cheap money that they need to grow . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china has modestly reduced its steel - making and coal - mining capacity . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj it has a lot more work to do . xxmaj china still has roughly the same steel - making capacity as the rest of the world combined . xxmaj china still has too many coal mines given its long - term plans to shift to more solar , wind and nuclear energy . xxmaj in many other industrial sectors , intense competition and slowing economic growth have curbed private investment . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj pay has been limited for top executives . a few enterprises have been merged , notably in rail equipment , to limit the extent to which they compete with one another for overseas sales . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj china ’s state - run companies remain bloated and inefficient . xxmaj monopolies and xxunk continue to dominate large sectors of the economy , like telecommunications and power transmission . xxmaj state - owned enterprises in sectors like steel making and coal mining tend to focus mainly on preserving employment for their workers , no matter how much money they need to borrow from state - controlled banks to cover financial losses . xxmaj and those pay limits ? xxmaj they may drive talented leaders to the private sector . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj faced with a shrinking labor force and a population that is rapidly graying , xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi ended xxmaj china ’s notorious one - child policy , with its fines and forced abortions , and his government has even begun mulling whether to offer incentives for families to have a second child . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj the labor force will continue to shrink for decades , presenting a serious drag on economic growth . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj the government has made it easier for migrant workers from rural areas to obtain residency and access to social benefits in medium - size and smaller cities . xxmaj the government is preparing to move the municipal bureaucracy of xxmaj beijing at the end of this year to an outlying suburb as part of an experiment aimed at testing whether it can build satellite cities around major metropolitan centers . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj rural migrants still have little hope of gaining residency in big cities like xxmaj beijing and xxmaj shanghai . xxmaj without residency , their access to medical insurance , education for their children and other benefits is limited . xxtitle xxmaj china and xxmaj economic xxmaj reform : xxmaj xi xxmaj jinping ’s xxmaj track xxmaj record,xxbos xxup london — xxmaj british xxmaj prime xxmaj minister xxmaj theresa xxmaj may said she ’ll discuss trade and security in a coming meeting with xxmaj president xxmaj donald xxmaj trump , his first visit from a foreign leader as president , underscoring the significance of their countries’ relationship . xxmaj britain , a longtime xxup u.s. ally , is seeking to build on its ties with the xxup u.s. as it leaves the xxmaj european xxmaj union . xxmaj mrs. xxmaj may ’s key objective on her visit to xxmaj washington on xxmaj friday will be to lay the ... xxtitle xxmaj trade to xxmaj be a xxmaj big xxmaj topic in xxmaj theresa xxmaj may ’s xxup u.s. xxmaj visit,xxbos xxmaj beaches come in all sorts of shapes and sizes beyond the typical xxmaj caribbean postcard . xxmaj as such ,   xxmaj national xxmaj geographic ’s new list of the xxmaj top 21 xxmaj beaches in the xxmaj world   includes a diverse mix of shorelines around the globe , from those picture -

old boy , was killed by a police officer in xxmaj cleveland last xxmaj november . a lengthy report published xxmaj saturday revealed new details about the fatal shooting of 12-year - old xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice by a xxmaj cleveland police officer , but made no recommendation on whether the officer or his partner should face criminal charges . xxmaj the report by the xxmaj cuyahoga xxmaj county xxmaj sheriff ’s xxmaj department also left some major questions unanswered . xxmaj perhaps foremost : xxmaj did xxmaj officer xxmaj tim xxmaj loehmann issue a warning before firing the fatal round ? xxmaj the police have said he did , but the new report suggested no witnesses heard any warning before shots were fired . xxmaj in the coming weeks or months , a grand jury is expected to hear evidence in the case and decide whether to bring indictments against xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann and his partner , xxmaj officer xxmaj frank xxmaj garmback . xxmaj but the sheriff ’s investigation provided the clearest picture yet about what happened on xxmaj nov. 22 outside the neighborhood recreation center that xxmaj tamir frequented , and where just before the shooting he had been using a newly acquired fake gun that looked strikingly like the real thing . xxmaj tamir ’s death led to protests in xxmaj cleveland and helped fuel a national debate about law enforcement tactics and how police treat xxmaj african - xxmaj americans . xxmaj much of what had been known previously came from surveillance footage that recorded the shooting and has circulated online for months , xxunk many who said the boy had no opportunity to drop the replica weapon before he was shot . xxmaj the video shows the police car sliding to a halt on the grass in front of a gazebo outside the recreation center . xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann , who was new to the force , quickly hopped out of the cruiser . xxmaj standing no more than seven feet from the boy , according to the report , he squeezed off two rounds from his handgun within two seconds of exiting the car . xxmaj some police officers who arrived at the scene in the tense minutes after the shooting recalled xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann saying that xxmaj tamir had a gun and had been reaching for it . xxmaj they also told investigators that they initially thought xxmaj tamir looked a good deal older than 12 . xxmaj officer xxmaj william xxmaj cunningham said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann was distraught . “   ‘ xxmaj he gave me no xxunk   ” xxmaj officer xxmaj cunningham said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann told him , according to the report . “   ‘ xxmaj he reached for the gun , and there was nothing i could do.’   ” xxmaj the report suggested that no witnesses heard any warning before shots were fired at xxmaj tamir , and it quoted one witness as saying a verbal warning had come only after two shots were fired . xxmaj the witness , who was not named , said she heard “ bang , bang , ” and then heard someone yell , “ xxmaj freeze ! xxmaj show me your hands , ” according to a summary of her interview with a detective . xxmaj after that , she then heard one more “ bang . ” xxmaj the sheriff ’s report said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann only fired twice . xxmaj the report found that , according to witness interviews , it was “ unclear whether xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann shouted verbal commands ” from his patrol car to xxmaj tamir before firing on him . xxmaj local leaders asked a judge to issue arrest warrants for two xxmaj cleveland policemen involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of 12-year - old xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice . xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann and xxmaj officer xxmaj garmback were sent to the scene after a 911 caller said he had seen someone outside the recreation center pulling a gun in and out of his pants and scaring people . xxmaj but the caller , who was not identified , also told the emergency operator , xxmaj constance xxmaj hollinger , that he believed xxmaj tamir was probably a juvenile and his gun probably fake — information that was never relayed to the two officers . xxmaj according to the new report , xxmaj ms. xxmaj hollinger ’s lawyer said prosecutors have told her that she is not a target of criminal prosecution . xxmaj yet during her interview with a police detective , on her lawyer ’s advice , she refused to tell investigators why she did not relay the caller ’s caveats . xxmaj no one provided xxmaj tamir medical assistance until an xxup f.b.i. agent who happened to be working nearby arrived . xxmaj that agent , also a certified paramedic , told investigators that xxmaj tamir had “ an incredibly disturbing looking injury ” and at first appeared unresponsive . xxmaj but eventually , the agent said , xxmaj tamir became alert , saying his name and that he had been shot . xxmaj the agent also recalled xxmaj tamir making some comment about a gun , but he was not sure what the boy said . xxmaj the xxmaj rice incident is one of several in recent years that have brought harsh attention to the xxmaj cleveland xxmaj division of xxmaj police . a scathing xxmaj justice xxmaj department report last year found a pattern of excessive force by xxmaj cleveland officers , and the city settled on a consent decree last month that calls for heightened monitoring and officer accountability . xxmaj that agreement came just days after xxmaj officer xxmaj michael xxmaj xxunk was acquitted of manslaughter for his role in a 2012 police chase that ended with two unarmed black people shot dead . xxmaj the police fired a total of 137 shots in that incident . xxmaj some xxmaj cleveland activists have expressed skepticism about the grand jury process , and days ago they used an obscure xxmaj ohio law to ask a xxmaj cleveland judge to issue arrest warrants for the two officers involved in xxmaj tamir ’s death . xxmaj the judge on xxmaj thursday found probable cause for an arrest on some counts against both officers , but said prosecutors would have to decide whether to seek warrants . xxmaj timothy xxup j. mcginty , the xxmaj cuyahoga xxmaj county prosecutor , has said he will allow the grand jury to decide whether the officers should be arrested and charged . xxmaj in a departure from high - profile cases elsewhere involving the police , xxmaj mr. mcginty chose to turn over the investigative documents xxmaj saturday before the decision on charges , a move he said would allow for a fuller understanding of the encounter . xxmaj walter xxmaj madison , a lawyer for the xxmaj rice family , said he believed that xxmaj mr. mcginty most likely decided to release the documents because of pressure after the judge ’s finding that there was probable cause to charge both officers . xxmaj mr. xxmaj madison also criticized xxmaj mr. mcginty for not ordering the arrest of the two officers after the judge ’s ruling . xxmaj by contrast , he said , the police and prosecutors “ do n’t hesitate to rely on the judge when he signs a search warrant or arrest warrant for a private citizen . ” xxtitle xxmaj sheriff ’s xxmaj report xxmaj provides xxmaj new xxmaj details on xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice ’s xxmaj death , but xxmaj leaves xxmaj questions,xxbos xxmaj an xxmaj italian neurosurgeon who has claimed for months that he will perform the world 's first human head transplant asked xxmaj americans to ' be xxmaj americans ' and donate to his cause .    xxmaj dr. xxmaj sergio xxmaj canavero 's plan to transplant the head of volunteer xxmaj valery xxmaj spiridonov , whose spinal muscular atrophy disease left him severely disabled , has been dubbed ' reckless ' by a number of fellow doctors . xxmaj but after making headlines for months , xxmaj canavero was invited to speak at a conference for   the xxmaj american xxmaj academy of xxmaj neurological and xxmaj orthopaedic xxmaj surgeons in xxmaj annapolis this week , and xxmaj spiridonov flew from xxmaj russia to both join and meet him for the first time . xxmaj scroll down for videos    xxmaj before leaving , xxmaj spiridonov told xxmaj mail xxmaj online he hoped he could help promote the idea of the surgery , and ultimately persuade the medical world to support it , by participating in the conference .    xxmaj canavero gave little detail of just how exactly he would pull off the operation while speaking at the conference , admitting at the end of an almost three hour lecture that his contribution would solely be dealing with the spinal cord .    xxmaj specifically , the surgeon said xxunk xxmaj spiridonov 's spine would require building a nano - blade with the ability to cut through nerve fibers without hurting them .    xxmaj he would also cut a bit lower than needed on xxmaj spiridonov 's spinal cord and a bit higher on the transplant body before giving them a last - minute second cut , which he said would help minimize cells dying off from the severed ends , according to the xxmaj national xxmaj geographic .    xxmaj the surgeon said he would then use polyethylene xxunk to join the ends together , adding electrical stimulation to encourage attachment .    xxmaj but other questions were left unanswered , such as how xxmaj spiridonov 's blood vessels would be reconnected or if the brain could even make it through the surgery without damage .    xxmaj the latter is a factor that xxmaj dr. xxmaj raymond xxmaj dieter said will make a successful head transplant impossible . ' xxmaj in three to five minutes , if we do n't have circulation back to your brain , you 're dead , ' the cardiothoracic surgeon told xxup nbc xxmaj news .    ' xxmaj when you look inside the skull , it 's mush . '    xxmaj regardless , xxmaj dieter said he thought it was ' phenomenal ' that xxmaj canavero , who likens himself to xxmaj dr. xxmaj frankenstein , is thinking outside of the box .    xxmaj it is that kind of enthusiasm xxmaj canavero is hoping will convince doctors of all specialties to join his team , promising them they will be ' paid through the nose ' .    ' i think doctors involved in this should be paid more than football players , ' he said .    xxmaj but it was the final question at the conference that showed that the transplant was not about xxmaj canavero or his doctors .    a reporter asked xxmaj spiridonov what he would say to people who tell him this surgery , which he hopes will happen in two years , should not be attempted .    ' xxmaj maybe , ' he said , ' they should imagine themselves in my place . '    xxtitle xxmaj surgeon claiming he will transplant volunteer 's xxup head to another body says he needs xxmaj america 's help to do it\n",

xxmaj wis . ) and endorsed by xxmaj president xxmaj donald xxmaj trump . xxmaj republicans are scrambling to get the bill to xxmaj trump ’s desk before xxmaj congress’ xxmaj easter recess , which begins xxmaj april 10 . xxmaj but given that much of the xxup gop rhetoric about the xxmaj affordable xxmaj care xxmaj act ’s flaws has focused on the financial losses some insurers have suffered under the law and the unaffordable premiums facing a segment of their consumers , it ’s not a good sign that xxmaj america ’s xxmaj health xxmaj insurance xxmaj plans   ( xxup xxunk ) has gone public with its misgivings about the bill that ’s supposed to solve those things . “ xxmaj we offer our comments on the recently - introduced xxmaj american xxmaj health xxmaj care xxmaj act in the spirit of working collaboratively with xxmaj congress and the xxmaj administration to find practical , workable solutions that improve affordability , value , and access , ” xxmaj marilyn xxmaj tavenner , xxup xxunk ’s chief executive , wrote in a letter to xxmaj house xxmaj ways and xxmaj means xxmaj committee xxmaj chairman xxmaj kevin xxmaj brady ( r -

based health insurance . xxmaj and both associations approve of certain specific measures , such as making available billions of dollars for states that need to shore up insurers . xxmaj that and other provisions are designed to stabilize the health insurance market in the next several years before the xxup gop ’s bigger changes would take effect . xxmaj insurers also support being able to charge older customers higher rates . xxmaj but insurers believe that eliminating the financial penalties associated with the xxmaj affordable xxmaj care xxmaj act ’s individual mandate ― which the xxmaj republican bill would do retroactively to xxmaj dec. 31 , 2015 ― “ would add short - term instability in the market . ” xxmaj in its memo , xxmaj blue xxmaj cross xxmaj blue xxmaj shield xxmaj association specifically requested that market - stabilization measures offering funding for the highest -

       "xxbos xxmaj economists generally agree : xxmaj china must overhaul its huge but wasteful economy if it wants to continue to grow in the years to come . xxmaj that means limiting political interference in banking and the financial system , making bloated industries more sensitive to market forces and lowering barriers against foreign trade and investment . xxmaj proponents took heart in late 2012 when xxmaj president xxmaj xi xxmaj jinping took formal control of the xxmaj chinese xxmaj communist xxmaj party with pledges to crack down on corruption and cut red tape . xxmaj today , as xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi nears the end of his first five - year term , much of the optimism among economists has faded . xxmaj china remains heavily dependent on large investments and has maintained brisk but slowing economic growth only with a steep rise in government - steered lending . xxmaj still , his administration has made some small changes , and there have been hints that xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi may focus more on economic overhauls when he starts his second term . xxmaj here is what xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi has done so far — and , more important , what he has not done . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj experts give some credit for xxmaj china ’s moves on currency . xxmaj beijing persuaded the xxmaj international xxmaj monetary xxmaj fund in 2015 to admit its currency , the renminbi , to an elite club of currencies in which central banks hold their reserves . xxmaj to win approval , xxmaj china made it much easier to move money in and out of the country , and shifted the daily pegging of the renminbi to the dollar to a slightly more market - based system . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj those moves have been in doubt lately . xxmaj opening up money flows led so many xxmaj chinese families and companies to send their money out of the country that the renminbi weakened against the dollar and the xxmaj chinese government had to spend nearly $ 1 trillion to prop it up . xxmaj in the past 12 months , xxmaj beijing has reimposed many restrictions on sending money out of the country . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj faced early last year with a huge supply of unsold real estate and stalling construction , xxmaj beijing decided to make it much easier for banks to issue mortgages . xxmaj this set off a buying frenzy in big cities that slightly pared the backlog of empty apartments . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj what looked like a bubble before looks like one even more so now . xxmaj beijing and xxmaj shanghai already have some of the world ’s highest real estate prices in relation to local incomes . xxmaj developers are still heavily in debt . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china made limited moves to allow foreigners to trade more extensively in the bond market , hedge their currency risk and connect its stock markets in xxmaj shanghai and xxmaj shenzhen with xxmaj hong xxmaj kong , which has long served as xxmaj china ’s financial gateway to the rest of the world . xxmaj local governments have been discouraged from setting up companies that borrow heavily to pay for public works . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj any moves to open up have been overshadowed by tighter government control after a 2015 stock market crash . a major stock market index passed on including xxmaj chinese stocks , citing the need for further improvements . xxmaj new public - private partnerships have emerged to continue xxmaj china ’s borrowing spree . xxmaj while xxmaj chinese officials had hoped that the private partners would force local governments to make wiser and more cautious investments , the initial “ private ” partners have tended to be state - owned enterprises , which typically share local xxunk interest in borrowing heavily to create jobs . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china has moved to help banks plagued by a rising tide of bad loans . xxmaj banks have been allowed to swap a few of those unpaid loans for equity stakes in troubled borrowers . xxmaj asset management companies have been buying some bad loans from banks . xxmaj banks have been given growing discretion to set interest rates based on the creditworthiness of borrowers . xxmaj the interest rates that banks pay on deposits have been deregulated , allowing a competition among banks that benefits depositors . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj those moves are not enough . xxmaj banks still face a large overhang of loans to money - losing companies with little hope of repayment . xxmaj banks continue to roll over loans to troubled borrowers and extend huge loans to politically connected borrowers , including influential private companies as well as state - owned enterprises . xxmaj if the economy does slow sharply , the mountain of bad loans will grow much more . xxmaj at the same time , entrepreneurs continue to complain that the system denies them the access to cheap money that they need to grow . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china has modestly reduced its steel - making and coal - mining capacity . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj it has a lot more work to do . xxmaj china still has roughly the same steel - making capacity as the rest of the world combined . xxmaj china still has too many coal mines given its long - term plans to shift to more solar , wind and nuclear energy . xxmaj in many other industrial sectors , intense competition and slowing economic growth have curbed private investment . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj pay has been limited for top executives . a few enterprises have been merged , notably in rail equipment , to limit the extent to which they compete with one another for overseas sales . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj china ’s state - run companies remain bloated and inefficient . xxmaj monopolies and xxunk continue to dominate large sectors of the economy , like telecommunications and power transmission . xxmaj state - owned enterprises in sectors like steel making and coal mining tend to focus mainly on preserving employment for their workers , no matter how much money they need to borrow from state - controlled banks to cover financial losses . xxmaj and those pay limits ? xxmaj they may drive talented leaders to the private sector . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj faced with a shrinking labor force and a population that is rapidly graying , xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi ended xxmaj china ’s notorious one - child policy , with its fines and forced abortions , and his government has even begun mulling whether to offer incentives for families to have a second child . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj the labor force will continue to shrink for decades , presenting a serious drag on economic growth . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj the government has made it easier for migrant workers from rural areas to obtain residency and access to social benefits in medium - size and smaller cities . xxmaj the government is preparing to move the municipal bureaucracy of xxmaj beijing at the end of this year to an outlying suburb as part of an experiment aimed at testing whether it can build satellite cities around major metropolitan centers . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj rural migrants still have little hope of gaining residency in big cities like xxmaj beijing and xxmaj shanghai . xxmaj without residency , their access to medical insurance , education for their children and other benefits is limited . xxtitle xxmaj china and xxmaj economic xxmaj reform : xxmaj xi xxmaj jinping ’s xxmaj track xxmaj record,xxbos xxup london — xxmaj british xxmaj prime xxmaj minister xxmaj theresa xxmaj may said she ’ll discuss trade and security in a coming meeting with xxmaj president xxmaj donald xxmaj trump , his first visit from a foreign leader as president , underscoring the significance of their countries’ relationship . xxmaj britain , a longtime xxup u.s. ally , is seeking to build on its ties with the xxup u.s. as it leaves the xxmaj european xxmaj union . xxmaj mrs. xxmaj may ’s key objective on her visit to xxmaj washington on xxmaj friday will be to lay the ... xxtitle xxmaj trade to xxmaj be a xxmaj big xxmaj topic in xxmaj theresa xxmaj may ’s xxup u.s. xxmaj visit,xxbos xxmaj beaches come in all sorts of shapes and sizes beyond the typical xxmaj caribbean postcard . xxmaj as such ,   xxmaj national xxmaj geographic ’s new list of the xxmaj top 21 xxmaj beaches in the xxmaj world   includes a diverse mix of shorelines around the globe , from those picture -

old boy , was killed by a police officer in xxmaj cleveland last xxmaj november . a lengthy report published xxmaj saturday revealed new details about the fatal shooting of 12-year - old xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice by a xxmaj cleveland police officer , but made no recommendation on whether the officer or his partner should face criminal charges . xxmaj the report by the xxmaj cuyahoga xxmaj county xxmaj sheriff ’s xxmaj department also left some major questions unanswered . xxmaj perhaps foremost : xxmaj did xxmaj officer xxmaj tim xxmaj loehmann issue a warning before firing the fatal round ? xxmaj the police have said he did , but the new report suggested no witnesses heard any warning before shots were fired . xxmaj in the coming weeks or months , a grand jury is expected to hear evidence in the case and decide whether to bring indictments against xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann and his partner , xxmaj officer xxmaj frank xxmaj garmback . xxmaj but the sheriff ’s investigation provided the clearest picture yet about what happened on xxmaj nov. 22 outside the neighborhood recreation center that xxmaj tamir frequented , and where just before the shooting he had been using a newly acquired fake gun that looked strikingly like the real thing . xxmaj tamir ’s death led to protests in xxmaj cleveland and helped fuel a national debate about law enforcement tactics and how police treat xxmaj african - xxmaj americans . xxmaj much of what had been known previously came from surveillance footage that recorded the shooting and has circulated online for months , xxunk many who said the boy had no opportunity to drop the replica weapon before he was shot . xxmaj the video shows the police car sliding to a halt on the grass in front of a gazebo outside the recreation center . xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann , who was new to the force , quickly hopped out of the cruiser . xxmaj standing no more than seven feet from the boy , according to the report , he squeezed off two rounds from his handgun within two seconds of exiting the car . xxmaj some police officers who arrived at the scene in the tense minutes after the shooting recalled xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann saying that xxmaj tamir had a gun and had been reaching for it . xxmaj they also told investigators that they initially thought xxmaj tamir looked a good deal older than 12 . xxmaj officer xxmaj william xxmaj cunningham said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann was distraught . “   ‘ xxmaj he gave me no xxunk   ” xxmaj officer xxmaj cunningham said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann told him , according to the report . “   ‘ xxmaj he reached for the gun , and there was nothing i could do.’   ” xxmaj the report suggested that no witnesses heard any warning before shots were fired at xxmaj tamir , and it quoted one witness as saying a verbal warning had come only after two shots were fired . xxmaj the witness , who was not named , said she heard “ bang , bang , ” and then heard someone yell , “ xxmaj freeze ! xxmaj show me your hands , ” according to a summary of her interview with a detective . xxmaj after that , she then heard one more “ bang . ” xxmaj the sheriff ’s report said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann only fired twice . xxmaj the report found that , according to witness interviews , it was “ unclear whether xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann shouted verbal commands ” from his patrol car to xxmaj tamir before firing on him . xxmaj local leaders asked a judge to issue arrest warrants for two xxmaj cleveland policemen involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of 12-year - old xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice . xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann and xxmaj officer xxmaj garmback were sent to the scene after a 911 caller said he had seen someone outside the recreation center pulling a gun in and out of his pants and scaring people . xxmaj but the caller , who was not identified , also told the emergency operator , xxmaj constance xxmaj hollinger , that he believed xxmaj tamir was probably a juvenile and his gun probably fake — information that was never relayed to the two officers . xxmaj according to the new report , xxmaj ms. xxmaj hollinger ’s lawyer said prosecutors have told her that she is not a target of criminal prosecution . xxmaj yet during her interview with a police detective , on her lawyer ’s advice , she refused to tell investigators why she did not relay the caller ’s caveats . xxmaj no one provided xxmaj tamir medical assistance until an xxup f.b.i. agent who happened to be working nearby arrived . xxmaj that agent , also a certified paramedic , told investigators that xxmaj tamir had “ an incredibly disturbing looking injury ” and at first appeared unresponsive . xxmaj but eventually , the agent said , xxmaj tamir became alert , saying his name and that he had been shot . xxmaj the agent also recalled xxmaj tamir making some comment about a gun , but he was not sure what the boy said . xxmaj the xxmaj rice incident is one of several in recent years that have brought harsh attention to the xxmaj cleveland xxmaj division of xxmaj police . a scathing xxmaj justice xxmaj department report last year found a pattern of excessive force by xxmaj cleveland officers , and the city settled on a consent decree last month that calls for heightened monitoring and officer accountability . xxmaj that agreement came just days after xxmaj officer xxmaj michael xxmaj xxunk was acquitted of manslaughter for his role in a 2012 police chase that ended with two unarmed black people shot dead . xxmaj the police fired a total of 137 shots in that incident . xxmaj some xxmaj cleveland activists have expressed skepticism about the grand jury process , and days ago they used an obscure xxmaj ohio law to ask a xxmaj cleveland judge to issue arrest warrants for the two officers involved in xxmaj tamir ’s death . xxmaj the judge on xxmaj thursday found probable cause for an arrest on some counts against both officers , but said prosecutors would have to decide whether to seek warrants . xxmaj timothy xxup j. mcginty , the xxmaj cuyahoga xxmaj county prosecutor , has said he will allow the grand jury to decide whether the officers should be arrested and charged . xxmaj in a departure from high - profile cases elsewhere involving the police , xxmaj mr. mcginty chose to turn over the investigative documents xxmaj saturday before the decision on charges , a move he said would allow for a fuller understanding of the encounter . xxmaj walter xxmaj madison , a lawyer for the xxmaj rice family , said he believed that xxmaj mr. mcginty most likely decided to release the documents because of pressure after the judge ’s finding that there was probable cause to charge both officers . xxmaj mr. xxmaj madison also criticized xxmaj mr. mcginty for not ordering the arrest of the two officers after the judge ’s ruling . xxmaj by contrast , he said , the police and prosecutors “ do n’t hesitate to rely on the judge when he signs a search warrant or arrest warrant for a private citizen . ” xxtitle xxmaj sheriff ’s xxmaj report xxmaj provides xxmaj new xxmaj details on xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice ’s xxmaj death , but xxmaj leaves xxmaj questions,xxbos xxmaj an xxmaj italian neurosurgeon who has claimed for months that he will perform the world 's first human head transplant asked xxmaj americans to ' be xxmaj americans ' and donate to his cause .    xxmaj dr. xxmaj sergio xxmaj canavero 's plan to transplant the head of volunteer xxmaj valery xxmaj spiridonov , whose spinal muscular atrophy disease left him severely disabled , has been dubbed ' reckless ' by a number of fellow doctors . xxmaj but after making headlines for months , xxmaj canavero was invited to speak at a conference for   the xxmaj american xxmaj academy of xxmaj neurological and xxmaj orthopaedic xxmaj surgeons in xxmaj annapolis this week , and xxmaj spiridonov flew from xxmaj russia to both join and meet him for the first time . xxmaj scroll down for videos    xxmaj before leaving , xxmaj spiridonov told xxmaj mail xxmaj online he hoped he could help promote the idea of the surgery , and ultimately persuade the medical world to support it , by participating in the conference .    xxmaj canavero gave little detail of just how exactly he would pull off the operation while speaking at the conference , admitting at the end of an almost three hour lecture that his contribution would solely be dealing with the spinal cord .    xxmaj specifically , the surgeon said xxunk xxmaj spiridonov 's spine would require building a nano - blade with the ability to cut through nerve fibers without hurting them .    xxmaj he would also cut a bit lower than needed on xxmaj spiridonov 's spinal cord and a bit higher on the transplant body before giving them a last - minute second cut , which he said would help minimize cells dying off from the severed ends , according to the xxmaj national xxmaj geographic .    xxmaj the surgeon said he would then use polyethylene xxunk to join the ends together , adding electrical stimulation to encourage attachment .    xxmaj but other questions were left unanswered , such as how xxmaj spiridonov 's blood vessels would be reconnected or if the brain could even make it through the surgery without damage .    xxmaj the latter is a factor that xxmaj dr. xxmaj raymond xxmaj dieter said will make a successful head transplant impossible . ' xxmaj in three to five minutes , if we do n't have circulation back to your brain , you 're dead , ' the cardiothoracic surgeon told xxup nbc xxmaj news .    ' xxmaj when you look inside the skull , it 's mush . '    xxmaj regardless , xxmaj dieter said he thought it was ' phenomenal ' that xxmaj canavero , who likens himself to xxmaj dr. xxmaj frankenstein , is thinking outside of the box .    xxmaj it is that kind of enthusiasm xxmaj canavero is hoping will convince doctors of all specialties to join his team , promising them they will be ' paid through the nose ' .    ' i think doctors involved in this should be paid more than football players , ' he said .    xxmaj but it was the final question at the conference that showed that the transplant was not about xxmaj canavero or his doctors .    a reporter asked xxmaj spiridonov what he would say to people who tell him this surgery , which he hopes will happen in two years , should not be attempted .    ' xxmaj maybe , ' he said , ' they should imagine themselves in my place . '    xxtitle xxmaj surgeon claiming he will transplant volunteer 's xxup head to another body says he needs xxmaj america 's help to do it\n",

xxmaj wis . ) and endorsed by xxmaj president xxmaj donald xxmaj trump . xxmaj republicans are scrambling to get the bill to xxmaj trump ’s desk before xxmaj congress’ xxmaj easter recess , which begins xxmaj april 10 . xxmaj but given that much of the xxup gop rhetoric about the xxmaj affordable xxmaj care xxmaj act ’s flaws has focused on the financial losses some insurers have suffered under the law and the unaffordable premiums facing a segment of their consumers , it ’s not a good sign that xxmaj america ’s xxmaj health xxmaj insurance xxmaj plans   ( xxup xxunk ) has gone public with its misgivings about the bill that ’s supposed to solve those things . “ xxmaj we offer our comments on the recently -

term instability in the market . ” xxmaj in its memo , xxmaj blue xxmaj cross xxmaj blue xxmaj shield xxmaj association specifically requested that market - stabilization measures offering funding for the highest -

       "xxbos xxmaj economists generally agree : xxmaj china must overhaul its huge but wasteful economy if it wants to continue to grow in the years to come . xxmaj that means limiting political interference in banking and the financial system , making bloated industries more sensitive to market forces and lowering barriers against foreign trade and investment . xxmaj proponents took heart in late 2012 when xxmaj president xxmaj xi xxmaj jinping took formal control of the xxmaj chinese xxmaj communist xxmaj party with pledges to crack down on corruption and cut red tape . xxmaj today , as xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi nears the end of his first five - year term , much of the optimism among economists has faded . xxmaj china remains heavily dependent on large investments and has maintained brisk but slowing economic growth only with a steep rise in government - steered lending . xxmaj still , his administration has made some small changes , and there have been hints that xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi may focus more on economic overhauls when he starts his second term . xxmaj here is what xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi has done so far — and , more important , what he has not done . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj experts give some credit for xxmaj china ’s moves on currency . xxmaj beijing persuaded the xxmaj international xxmaj monetary xxmaj fund in 2015 to admit its currency , the renminbi , to an elite club of currencies in which central banks hold their reserves . xxmaj to win approval , xxmaj china made it much easier to move money in and out of the country , and shifted the daily pegging of the renminbi to the dollar to a slightly more market - based system . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj those moves have been in doubt lately . xxmaj opening up money flows led so many xxmaj chinese families and companies to send their money out of the country that the renminbi weakened against the dollar and the xxmaj chinese government had to spend nearly $ 1 trillion to prop it up . xxmaj in the past 12 months , xxmaj beijing has reimposed many restrictions on sending money out of the country . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj faced early last year with a huge supply of unsold real estate and stalling construction , xxmaj beijing decided to make it much easier for banks to issue mortgages . xxmaj this set off a buying frenzy in big cities that slightly pared the backlog of empty apartments . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj what looked like a bubble before looks like one even more so now . xxmaj beijing and xxmaj shanghai already have some of the world ’s highest real estate prices in relation to local incomes . xxmaj developers are still heavily in debt . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china made limited moves to allow foreigners to trade more extensively in the bond market , hedge their currency risk and connect its stock markets in xxmaj shanghai and xxmaj shenzhen with xxmaj hong xxmaj kong , which has long served as xxmaj china ’s financial gateway to the rest of the world . xxmaj local governments have been discouraged from setting up companies that borrow heavily to pay for public works . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj any moves to open up have been overshadowed by tighter government control after a 2015 stock market crash . a major stock market index passed on including xxmaj chinese stocks , citing the need for further improvements . xxmaj new public - private partnerships have emerged to continue xxmaj china ’s borrowing spree . xxmaj while xxmaj chinese officials had hoped that the private partners would force local governments to make wiser and more cautious investments , the initial “ private ” partners have tended to be state - owned enterprises , which typically share local xxunk interest in borrowing heavily to create jobs . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china has moved to help banks plagued by a rising tide of bad loans . xxmaj banks have been allowed to swap a few of those unpaid loans for equity stakes in troubled borrowers . xxmaj asset management companies have been buying some bad loans from banks . xxmaj banks have been given growing discretion to set interest rates based on the creditworthiness of borrowers . xxmaj the interest rates that banks pay on deposits have been deregulated , allowing a competition among banks that benefits depositors . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj those moves are not enough . xxmaj banks still face a large overhang of loans to money - losing companies with little hope of repayment . xxmaj banks continue to roll over loans to troubled borrowers and extend huge loans to politically connected borrowers , including influential private companies as well as state - owned enterprises . xxmaj if the economy does slow sharply , the mountain of bad loans will grow much more . xxmaj at the same time , entrepreneurs continue to complain that the system denies them the access to cheap money that they need to grow . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj china has modestly reduced its steel - making and coal - mining capacity . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj it has a lot more work to do . xxmaj china still has roughly the same steel - making capacity as the rest of the world combined . xxmaj china still has too many coal mines given its long - term plans to shift to more solar , wind and nuclear energy . xxmaj in many other industrial sectors , intense competition and slowing economic growth have curbed private investment . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj pay has been limited for top executives . a few enterprises have been merged , notably in rail equipment , to limit the extent to which they compete with one another for overseas sales . xxmaj lingering problems : xxmaj china ’s state - run companies remain bloated and inefficient . xxmaj monopolies and xxunk continue to dominate large sectors of the economy , like telecommunications and power transmission . xxmaj state - owned enterprises in sectors like steel making and coal mining tend to focus mainly on preserving employment for their workers , no matter how much money they need to borrow from state - controlled banks to cover financial losses . xxmaj and those pay limits ? xxmaj they may drive talented leaders to the private sector . xxmaj reforms : xxmaj faced with a shrinking labor force and a population that is rapidly graying , xxmaj mr. xxmaj xi ended xxmaj china ’s notorious one -

old boy , was killed by a police officer in xxmaj cleveland last xxmaj november . a lengthy report published xxmaj saturday revealed new details about the fatal shooting of 12-year - old xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice by a xxmaj cleveland police officer , but made no recommendation on whether the officer or his partner should face criminal charges . xxmaj the report by the xxmaj cuyahoga xxmaj county xxmaj sheriff ’s xxmaj department also left some major questions unanswered . xxmaj perhaps foremost : xxmaj did xxmaj officer xxmaj tim xxmaj loehmann issue a warning before firing the fatal round ? xxmaj the police have said he did , but the new report suggested no witnesses heard any warning before shots were fired . xxmaj in the coming weeks or months , a grand jury is expected to hear evidence in the case and decide whether to bring indictments against xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann and his partner , xxmaj officer xxmaj frank xxmaj garmback . xxmaj but the sheriff ’s investigation provided the clearest picture yet about what happened on xxmaj nov. 22 outside the neighborhood recreation center that xxmaj tamir frequented , and where just before the shooting he had been using a newly acquired fake gun that looked strikingly like the real thing . xxmaj tamir ’s death led to protests in xxmaj cleveland and helped fuel a national debate about law enforcement tactics and how police treat xxmaj african - xxmaj americans . xxmaj much of what had been known previously came from surveillance footage that recorded the shooting and has circulated online for months , xxunk many who said the boy had no opportunity to drop the replica weapon before he was shot . xxmaj the video shows the police car sliding to a halt on the grass in front of a gazebo outside the recreation center . xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann , who was new to the force , quickly hopped out of the cruiser . xxmaj standing no more than seven feet from the boy , according to the report , he squeezed off two rounds from his handgun within two seconds of exiting the car . xxmaj some police officers who arrived at the scene in the tense minutes after the shooting recalled xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann saying that xxmaj tamir had a gun and had been reaching for it . xxmaj they also told investigators that they initially thought xxmaj tamir looked a good deal older than 12 . xxmaj officer xxmaj william xxmaj cunningham said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann was distraught . “   ‘ xxmaj he gave me no xxunk   ” xxmaj officer xxmaj cunningham said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann told him , according to the report . “   ‘ xxmaj he reached for the gun , and there was nothing i could do.’   ” xxmaj the report suggested that no witnesses heard any warning before shots were fired at xxmaj tamir , and it quoted one witness as saying a verbal warning had come only after two shots were fired . xxmaj the witness , who was not named , said she heard “ bang , bang , ” and then heard someone yell , “ xxmaj freeze ! xxmaj show me your hands , ” according to a summary of her interview with a detective . xxmaj after that , she then heard one more “ bang . ” xxmaj the sheriff ’s report said xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann only fired twice . xxmaj the report found that , according to witness interviews , it was “ unclear whether xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann shouted verbal commands ” from his patrol car to xxmaj tamir before firing on him . xxmaj local leaders asked a judge to issue arrest warrants for two xxmaj cleveland policemen involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of 12-year - old xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice . xxmaj officer xxmaj loehmann and xxmaj officer xxmaj garmback were sent to the scene after a 911 caller said he had seen someone outside the recreation center pulling a gun in and out of his pants and scaring people . xxmaj but the caller , who was not identified , also told the emergency operator , xxmaj constance xxmaj hollinger , that he believed xxmaj tamir was probably a juvenile and his gun probably fake — information that was never relayed to the two officers . xxmaj according to the new report , xxmaj ms. xxmaj hollinger ’s lawyer said prosecutors have told her that she is not a target of criminal prosecution . xxmaj yet during her interview with a police detective , on her lawyer ’s advice , she refused to tell investigators why she did not relay the caller ’s caveats . xxmaj no one provided xxmaj tamir medical assistance until an xxup f.b.i. agent who happened to be working nearby arrived . xxmaj that agent , also a certified paramedic , told investigators that xxmaj tamir had “ an incredibly disturbing looking injury ” and at first appeared unresponsive . xxmaj but eventually , the agent said , xxmaj tamir became alert , saying his name and that he had been shot . xxmaj the agent also recalled xxmaj tamir making some comment about a gun , but he was not sure what the boy said . xxmaj the xxmaj rice incident is one of several in recent years that have brought harsh attention to the xxmaj cleveland xxmaj division of xxmaj police . a scathing xxmaj justice xxmaj department report last year found a pattern of excessive force by xxmaj cleveland officers , and the city settled on a consent decree last month that calls for heightened monitoring and officer accountability . xxmaj that agreement came just days after xxmaj officer xxmaj michael xxmaj xxunk was acquitted of manslaughter for his role in a 2012 police chase that ended with two unarmed black people shot dead . xxmaj the police fired a total of 137 shots in that incident . xxmaj some xxmaj cleveland activists have expressed skepticism about the grand jury process , and days ago they used an obscure xxmaj ohio law to ask a xxmaj cleveland judge to issue arrest warrants for the two officers involved in xxmaj tamir ’s death . xxmaj the judge on xxmaj thursday found probable cause for an arrest on some counts against both officers , but said prosecutors would have to decide whether to seek warrants . xxmaj timothy xxup j. mcginty , the xxmaj cuyahoga xxmaj county prosecutor , has said he will allow the grand jury to decide whether the officers should be arrested and charged . xxmaj in a departure from high - profile cases elsewhere involving the police , xxmaj mr. mcginty chose to turn over the investigative documents xxmaj saturday before the decision on charges , a move he said would allow for a fuller understanding of the encounter . xxmaj walter xxmaj madison , a lawyer for the xxmaj rice family , said he believed that xxmaj mr. mcginty most likely decided to release the documents because of pressure after the judge ’s finding that there was probable cause to charge both officers . xxmaj mr. xxmaj madison also criticized xxmaj mr. mcginty for not ordering the arrest of the two officers after the judge ’s ruling . xxmaj by contrast , he said , the police and prosecutors “ do n’t hesitate to rely on the judge when he signs a search warrant or arrest warrant for a private citizen . ” xxtitle xxmaj sheriff ’s xxmaj report xxmaj provides xxmaj new xxmaj details on xxmaj tamir xxmaj rice ’s xxmaj death , but xxmaj leaves xxmaj questions,xxbos xxmaj an xxmaj italian neurosurgeon who has claimed for months that he will perform the world 's first human head transplant asked xxmaj americans to ' be xxmaj americans ' and donate to his cause .    xxmaj dr. xxmaj sergio xxmaj canavero 's plan to transplant the head of volunteer xxmaj valery xxmaj spiridonov , whose spinal muscular atrophy disease left him severely disabled , has been dubbed ' reckless ' by a number of fellow doctors . xxmaj but after making headlines for months , xxmaj canavero was invited to speak at a conference for   the xxmaj american xxmaj academy of xxmaj neurological and xxmaj orthopaedic xxmaj surgeons in xxmaj annapolis this week , and xxmaj spiridonov flew from xxmaj russia to both join and meet him for the first time . xxmaj scroll down for videos    xxmaj before leaving , xxmaj spiridonov told xxmaj mail xxmaj online he hoped he could help promote the idea of the surgery , and ultimately persuade the medical world to support it , by participating in the conference .    xxmaj canavero gave little detail of just how exactly he would pull off the operation while speaking at the conference , admitting at the end of an almost three hour lecture that his contribution would solely be dealing with the spinal cord .    xxmaj specifically , the surgeon said xxunk xxmaj spiridonov 's spine would require building a nano - blade with the ability to cut through nerve fibers without hurting them .    xxmaj he would also cut a bit lower than needed on xxmaj spiridonov 's spinal cord and a bit higher on the transplant body before giving them a last - minute second cut , which he said would help minimize cells dying off from the severed ends , according to the xxmaj national xxmaj geographic .    xxmaj the surgeon said he would then use polyethylene xxunk to join the ends together , adding electrical stimulation to encourage attachment .    xxmaj but other questions were left unanswered , such as how xxmaj spiridonov 's blood vessels would be reconnected or if the brain could even make it through the surgery without damage .    xxmaj the latter is a factor that xxmaj dr. xxmaj raymond xxmaj dieter said will make a successful head transplant impossible . ' xxmaj in three to five minutes , if we do n't have circulation back to your brain , you 're dead , ' the cardiothoracic surgeon told xxup nbc xxmaj news .    ' xxmaj when you look inside the skull , it 's mush . '    xxmaj regardless , xxmaj dieter said he thought it was ' phenomenal ' that xxmaj canavero , who likens himself to xxmaj dr. xxmaj frankenstein , is thinking outside of the box .    xxmaj it is that kind of enthusiasm xxmaj canavero is hoping will convince doctors of all specialties to join his team , promising them they will be ' paid through the nose ' .    ' i think doctors involved in this should be paid more than football players , ' he said .    xxmaj but it was the final question at the conference that showed that the transplant was not about xxmaj canavero or his doctors .    a reporter asked xxmaj spiridonov what he would say to people who tell him this surgery , which he hopes will happen in two years , should not be attempted .    ' xxmaj maybe , ' he said , ' they should imagine themselves in my place .
